Sometimes I just. Dislike some peoples renditions of countries. Don't get me wrong there's not much wrong with them but it just pisses me off iykwim. It sucks even more when EVERYONE ELSE likes it. And I know realistically there's not much of a reason to dislike it, i mean like it's not as bad as some peoples versions but at least I can openly dislike that. What's gonna happen when suddenly I start talking trash about someones Argentina that has sheep features, is probably some sort of twink, and has like DID or something? (This doesn't actually exist I'm just using it as an example) I guess if anything, it's a pet peeve. A really big one. And what's gonna happen when everyone else around me actually LIKES that rendition? I literally just have to end up making one of my own to cope with now much it annoys me. I would care less if it were any other piece of media but be mindful... These are countries. This fandom a hellhole.
