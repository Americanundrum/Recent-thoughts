boing boing boing boing hey if youre reading this, just know that i do NOT like that the TADC fandom is hogging up our space! it was fine when Murder Drones settled because they weren't ANNOOYIINNNGG and minded their own. The ponytown fanbase is so unecessarily clogging up our area and i can say for a fact the rest of us thinks it's duuummbb <3
